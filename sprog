Reduce, if you're smoking, or bid them goodbye!

Consider a budget, or system to save -  
It's easy to yield to the stuff that you crave!  
Account for your cash, and the life that you lead -  
Make lists when you're shopping and get what you need!

Remember: it's not about crafting a ploy  
To drop or deny all the things you enjoy -  
To linger, surviving on ramen and beans -  
It's just about living inside of your means.

is all in your head.  

You hope in your heart

You hope and you hope

Be cruel and insensitive, soon you will see -

And know with a smile that I have you to keep -  
And think with a hope in my heart and a pride -  
How lucky I am to have you by my side.  

I watch, with my hand in your hand and with glee -  
I can't understand how this happened to be.  

I look to the stars and I whisper *amen*.

There were no fears;

A shadow is creeping and crawling ahead.  
It walks to your kitchen -  
it opens the door -  
It steps,  
then it steps just a little bit more.

It goes to your cupboards, your sideboard, your sink -  
It looks and it stops in the silence to think.  
It turns and it reaches its fingers to where -  
You pack all your lunches and dinners prepare.  

It roots through the shelving -  
it picks at the doors -  
And when it has finished, it leaves with your stores.  
It's gone just as quick as it thought to intrude.  

Your kitchen is empty.  
 
It's Robin Mahfood."

The claws inside the gloom.  

He paused to see the paws, the size,  
The shape, the strength, the might -  
The pair of evil, watching eyes,  
That shone from out the night.

He didn't fret.

Have you ever heard the churning  
Whispered sound of paper turning?  
Have you heard the rustle-wrinkle  
Rumpled hush of paper crinkle?

Have you thought to steal a fiction  
Just to find to your affliction  
Shadows stalking books for stacking?  
Shapes behind the paper-backing?

Have you hidden tomes for study  
On your own or with a buddy,  
Just to hear at edge of hearing  
Something softly scrunching nearing?

If you've seen these aberrations,  
Spied these strange associations,  
Warning, would-be-perpetrator - 

*Well beware the page-curator.*"

A *choice* to be taking and making for you. 

Of course you will worry and fret for yourself -  
But life isn't meant to be lived from a shelf!  
You have to be brave and you must see it through -  
Go put yourself out there!   

It's all you can do.

"You've woken for days and for weeks with her there -  
You've spoken of chances and futures you'll share -  
And though there was trouble and worry and doubt -  
Perhaps you were hoping you'd just work it out.  

Perhaps you agreed it's the right thing to do -  
She isn't, she wasn't the person for you -  
And though you had tried and you'd hoped that you were -  
You're clearly not really the right one for her.  

Whatever the reason, you have to decide -  
That can you be happy just there by her side?  
If something within you is telling you *no* -   
The answer is certain. 

You just have to go."

One splendid summer's dawn -  
He watched with hope and joyful cheer  
This dainty spotted fawn.  

\"But what more perfect beast,\" said he,  
\"Could overshadow this?  
'Tis such a darling thing to see  
An ungulate of bliss.

And sometimes you'll doubt -  
And sometimes you'll work,  
But it just won't work out.

It's toil and it's trouble,  
This troubling life -  
It's juggling stress,  
And it's struggle and strife -  
It's bearing the bad times,  
And riding the rough -  
It's knowing you tried,  
But it wasn't enough.

But try all the same,  
With a hope in your heart -  
Be sad but be strong,  
And be ready to start -  
The bad times will hurt,  
And the dreadful times too -  
You have to survive them.

It's all you can do."

I could speak the words and then -  
When you've heard them softly spoken,  
I could break your heart again.  

I could find a way to say it  
So that maybe they would stay -  
But you'll ask me to convey it  
Just the same tomorrow day.

So I know what I will tell you  
When you wake this afternoon.  

It's the kindest lie to sell you.
  
I will answer: \"... maybe soon.\""

Takes a whiff of meaty air.  

\"CRUNCH AND MUNCH FOR LUNCH,\" says he.  
Holds the lumps with greedy glee.  
Smells the scent and *oh*, it's sweet.  

Tummy rumbles.

Time to eat."

"See that unassuming man?  
Making do with what he can?  
Getting on with what he's got?  
Happy with his little lot?  

See that self-effacing guy?  
Working hard and getting by?  
Standing tall to make ends meet?  
Walking down an empty street?

See that humble human there?  
Hauling ground to make his share?  
Tilling earth and sowing seed?  

What's he planting?  

Yep, that's weed."

"'You mustn't *question* me, my dear,  
Not up or down, or far or near,  
Or front or back, or fast or slow,  
Nor ever, ever, never, no.

'You mustn't *question* me, my love,  
Not left or right, below, above,  
Or old or new, or big or small,  
Or any way, in fact, at all. 

'You mustn't *question* me, my heart,  
Not at the end, or at the start,  
Or to or fro, or low or high.'  

He scratched his head.

He said:  

'... but why?'"

"When I'm on my own and lonely,  
And I've nowhere else to be -  
Then I take a moment only,  
And I make the time for me.  

I illuminate a candle -   
I select a glass of wine -  
And I slowly start to handle,  
Start to fondle what is mine.  

For I do not need a threesome,  
Nor a twosome,  
to be frank.  

Just a onesome.  

Just a mesome.  

Just a happy lonesome wank.

"When Little Timmy took the train,  
One fine but fateful day -  
He slowly closed his eyes in pain  
As tunes began to play.  

The music blared from close behind -  
It crashed and smashed and then -  
It bounded 'round his aching mind  
And round around again!  

He sighed and made a mighty frown -  
\"For heaven's sake!\" he cried.  
\"I must insist you turn it down!\"  

And Timmy fucking died."

"When Little Timmy went to school,  
And sat down next to Stu -  
He said: \"I'm really far more cool,  
And popular than you!

\"You're such a total *nerd*!\" said Tim,  
\"An utter waste of youth!\"  
For Stu had fewer friends than him,  
Or \"followers\", in truth.  

But Stu was up and standing tall.  
He raised his fists with pride.  

For this was Level One,  
that's all.  

And Timmy fucking died."

"\"I would piss myself, my dearest -  
I would dampen down below -  
I would moisten all the nearest  
Chaps and chinos,

\"I would urinate with passion  
Every time I heard it spake -  
Every garment forged in fashion  
Would be wetted in my wake.  

\"And I'd sprinkle and I'd spatter  
And I'd saturate and spray -  
And I'd tinkle, spot and splatter  
Every night and every day!  

\"Yes I'd do it without worry,  
And forever I'd be blessed.  

I would do it a hurry.  

Say *banana*. 

Be my guest.\""

"'Do you down it,  
Do you drink it,   
Do you drain it from a jug?  
Do you swirl and swill and sink it  
From a saucer or a mug?  

'Do you sip a tiny tipple,  
Sup an itty-bitty bit?  
Sip a little from the nipple,  
Or a taster from the tit?  

'When you're draining,  
When you're drinking,  
Do you pick yourself a breast?  
When you're choosing are you thinking  
Of whichever one is best?

'See I'd like to know what's in it -  
How *precisely* you decide.'  

So the Centaur thought a minute.  

'... well I'll show you,' it replied."

"\"I look like a sausage,\" he said with a sigh.  
\"As ugly and ever as round as a pie.  
I'm plain and unpleasant, unshapely and stout -  
With all of the face and the grace of a trout.  

\"I'm quite unappealing,\" he said with distress.  
\"And rather deformed and disfigured, I guess.  
Revolting, repulsive, repugnant and rough -  
Unseemly, unshapely, unsightly enough.  

\"And worse,\" he explained with a shake of his head,  
\"I'm dumb as a bag full of hammers,\" he said.  
He finished in silence.  
He waited in woe.  

She whispered: \"... at least you've got *honesty*, bro.\""

">every time you abused the fast pass system someone had to wait an extra minute or so in line...

When Little Timmy stood in line,  
The last to take a ride -  
He grinned to think the day divine,  
With hope and glee inside.  

At thirty-something thousand feet  
A plane went drifting by -  
To places far away and sweet,  
It sailed beyond the sky.

Beneath a wing some ice had formed,  
And grew by dawn of day -  
And when in sun it slowly warmed,  
It simply slipped away.

It curled and twirled and flaked in fall  
Towards that closing ride.
  
But Timmy hadn't moved at all.   

And Timmy fucking died."

Little pupper, how are you?

Getting thinner 'round the rear!

"This cute and beauty bae of mine  
Is sweet and neat and fine and fair,  
She's all delight,  
and all divine,  
With long and silky silver hair,  
And though she might be past her prime,  
I think she's all a girl should be,  
And no revolving wheel of time  
Could take her love away from me.   

She's dear and dainty, shaped in grace,  
And every word she speak's a song,  
And when I see her face-to-face,  
I know it's true and sure and strong,  
There's really only one complaint,  
The slightest doubt, the smallest glitch,  
A minor woe, a tiny taint -  

She gave me crabs.  

My bollocks itch."
